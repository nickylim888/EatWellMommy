            msg: "According to Eatright.org, apples are a safe and healthy choice during pregnancy. However, it is essential that pregnant women wash their apples prior to eating them. Unwashed produce may contain harmful bacteria and parasites that can cause food-borne diseases such as toxoplasmosis and listeriosis according to the FDA and the American Pregnancy Association."
        },
        walnut: {
            msg: "Walnuts, with 2.6 grams in a 1-ounce serving, serve as the best nut source of omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fats found in just a few foods. Omega-3 fatty acids aid your baby's brain development. Many pregnant women have trouble getting an adequate supply of omega-3 fatty acid because of the recommendation that pregnant women not eat more than 12 ounces of fish per week due to the risk of mercury contamination. Fatty fish are one of the best dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Walnuts also contain monounsaturated fats that can help lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease. Like all nuts, walnuts can help you meet your protein requirements, supplying 4 grams of protein per ounce. You need between 75 and 100 grams of protein per day during pregnancy, the American Pregnancy Association advises."
        },
       broccoli: {
            msg: "Broccoli has an impressive nutritional profile. It is high in fiber, very high in vitamin C and has potassium, B6 and vitamin A, raved Victoria Jarzabkowski, a nutritionist with the Fitness Institute of Texas at the University of Texas at Austin. For a nonstarchy vegetable, it has a good amount of protein. Broccoli is also packed with phytochemicals and antioxidants. Phytochemicals are chemicals in plants that are responsible for color, smell and flavor. Research shows that they have numerous healthful benefits, according to the American Institute for Cancer Research. Phytochemicals in broccoli are good for the immune system. They include glucobrassicin; carotenoids, such as zeaxanthin and beta-carotene; and kaempferol, a flavonoid."
        },
        cheese: {
            msg: "You would need to avoid soft cheeses such as: Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Feta, Gorgonzola and Mexican style cheeses that include queso blanco and queso fresco, unless they clearly state that they are made from pasteurized milk. All soft non-imported cheeses made with pasteurized milk are safe to eat."
        },
        fish: {
            msg: "Mercury is a contaminant found in fish that can affect brain development and the nervous system. The FDA has released guidelines for children, women who are pregnant and women who are trying to become pregnant.  These guidelines state that no more than 12 oz of low mercury fish should be consumed weekly. “Highest” mercury fish should be avoided and “high” mercury fish should be kept to only three 6-oz servings per month."
        },
        coffee: {
            msg: "Caffeine crosses the placenta to your baby. Although you may be able to handle the amounts of caffeine you feed your body, your baby cannot. Your baby’s metabolism is still maturing and cannot fully metabolize the caffeine. Any amount of caffeine can also cause changes in your baby’s sleep pattern or normal movement pattern in the later stages of pregnancy. Remember, caffeine is a stimulant and can keep both you and your baby awake. Caffeine is found in more than just coffee.  Caffeine is not only found in coffee but also in tea, soda, chocolate, and even some over-the-counter medications that relieve headaches. Be aware of what you consume."
        },
        wine: {
            msg: "Although regular consumption of alcohol has been clearly associated with fetal alcohol syndrome — a disorder characterized by retardation, birth defects, and neurological impairment — many obstetricians feel comfortable with their patients having an occasional drink (a glass of wine or a beer every once in a while) in the second and third trimesters. Just remember that the safety of drinking alcohol during pregnancy hasn't been clearly documented because the effects on a developing fetus may be so subtle or not yet identified."
        },
        sugar: {
            msg: "During pregnancy – usually around the 24th week – many women develop gestational diabetes. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes doesn't mean that you had diabetes before you conceived, or that you will have diabetes after giving birth. But it's important to follow your doctor's advice regarding blood glucose (blood sugar) levels while you're planning your pregnancy, so you and your baby both remain healthy."
        },
        beets: {
            msg: "Iron is very much essential for almost every woman at any point in time but during pregnancy, it is even more so. It helps enhance the hemoglobin content of the blood. Thus, a pregnant woman is advised to consume the juice of beetroot for increasing the iron content of the body. Beetroot juice during pregnancy keeps woman from developing an anemic condition."
        },
        asparagus: {
            msg: "Compared to any other vegetables, aspargus is known to have the highest amount of folic acid that you richly deserve in your pregnancy. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects (NTDs)—serious birth defects of the spinal cord (such as spina bifida) and the brain (such as anencephaly). Neural tube defects occur at a very early stage of development, before many women even know they're pregnant. They affect about 3,000 pregnancies a year in the United States."
        },
        DHA: {
            msg: "Dietary sources of DHA include: Algae - Certain microalgae are natural sources of DHA. While most people believe that fish produce their own DHA, in fact, it’s the algae they feed on that make them a rich source of DHA. A natural vegetarian source of DHA can now be produced from microalgae and is currently available in dietary supplements, fortified foods, and a number of infant formulas sold worldwide.Fatty fish including anchovies, salmon, herring, mackerel, tuna and halibut. Organ meat such as liver. Fish oil. Small amounts are found in poultry and egg yolks. There is a common misconception that flaxseed oil is a dietary source of DHA. However, flaxseed oil is a source of alpha-linolenic acid, ALA, a precursor of DHA. ALA has no known independent benefits on brain or eye development and function, compared to DHA. Although the human body can convert ALA to DHA, the process is inefficient and variable."
        },
        nuts: {
            msg: "Children could have a lower risk of developing a peanut allergy if their mothers eat more nuts in pregnancy, researchers claim. Their study adds to growing evidence that eating nuts while expecting a baby  has no damaging effect on the unborn child. Those with peanut allergies can develop breathing problems if they eat or come into contact with nuts. The most severely affected are at risk of life-threatening anaphylactic shock."
